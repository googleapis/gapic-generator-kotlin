# Cloud APIs

This directory contains a snapshot of some of Google's API definitions.

These API definitions are used in the examples to generate a Kotlin client library
that can be used to call the API. If you'd like to see all of Google's published API 
definitions, see (googleapis)[https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis].
